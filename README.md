# CS161-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains programming projects completed in the course COM SCI 161: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence at UCLA during winter quarter 2023, taught by Professor Quanquan Gu.

## Course Content
The course introduces the design of intelligent agents, including the fundamental problem-solving and knowledge-representation paradigms of artificial intelligence. Topics covered include state-space and problem reduction methods, brute-force and heuristic search, game playing. For knowledge representation and reasoning, the course covers propositional and first-order logic and their inference algorithms. Finally, the course covers probabilistic approaches to AI, such as Bayesian networks to improve the agentâ€™s performance with experience.
