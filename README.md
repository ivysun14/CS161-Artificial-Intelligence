# CS161-Artificial-Intelligence

This repository contains programming projects completed in the course COM SCI 161: Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence at UCLA during winter quarter 2023, taught by Professor Quanquan Gu.

## Course Content
The course introduces the design of intelligent agents, including the fundamental problem-solving and knowledge-representation paradigms of artificial intelligence. Topics covered include state-space and problem reduction methods, brute-force and heuristic search, game playing. For knowledge representation and reasoning, the course covers propositional and first-order logic and their inference algorithms. Finally, the course covers probabilistic approaches to AI, such as Bayesian networks to improve the agent’s performance with experience.

## Assignment Overview
- HW1 - Python Warm-up
  - Wrote multiple python functions using BFS, DFS traversal in tree-type problems.
- HW2 - “Gone Maggie Gone” Problem in Homer Simpson
  - Wrote a python program to solve the famous fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle by modeling it as a state search problem.
- HW3 - Sokoban
  - Wrote python program to model the Sokoban game as a state search problem and solved it with A* search. Designed original heuristic function to enhance the performance of A* search by significantly reducing its runtime when finding puzzle solutions.

- HW4 - Graph Coloring and SAT Problem
  - Wrote python program to convert graph coloring problems into SAT problems and used a SAT solver to solve them.
- HW5 - Propositional & First-Order Logic
  - Non-coding assignment focuses on representing sentences as logical statements and performing resolution to prove/disprove a statement
- HW6 - Bayesian Networks
  - Non-coding assignment focuses on constructing bayesian networks and calculating probabilities.
