Question 1:
As the value of N gets larger, the time it takes to calculate the Padovan number increases exponentially. 
This is because the resursion level is getting deeper and there are redundancy in the recursion each time a new number is generated in the sequence.

Question 2:
______________
| PAD | SUMS |    The value of SUMS(N) is given by the relationship SUMS(N) + 1 = PAD(N).
| ---------- |    This is because the number of addition it will take increases with the depth of recursion.
|  1  |  0   |    In PAD(N), everytime the recursive step is called, the program is one level deeper in the recursion
|  1  |  0   |    which means there is one additional addition. Essentially SUMS(N) is calculating the
|  1  |  0   |    time complexity of PAD(N), since each addition takes O(1) time and it takes SUMS(N) number of 
|  2  |  1   |    additions to calculatee PAD(N).
